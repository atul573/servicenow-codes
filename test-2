new twst Subject: Justification for Travel Booking from Home Town

Dear [Booking Partner's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to provide a justification for my recent travel booking from my home town rather than my base location.

This is my first time booking travel through our system, and I was not aware of the policy requiring travel to be initiated from the base location. The purpose of my travel is to attend a client visit in [Client Location], and due to the proximity of my home town to the client location, I believed it would be more efficient to travel directly from here.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate your understanding. Moving forward, I will ensure to adhere strictly to the travel policies. I kindly request your approval for this booking considering the circumstances and my lack of prior knowledge about the policy.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
